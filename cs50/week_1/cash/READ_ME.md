# Week 1 Problem - Cash

In this problem the user submit a value of change and the code had to 
return the minimum coins necessary (between 0,25; 0,10; 0,05 and 0,01)
to sum the change.

For this after get the user submit change was rounded to int cents
and a variable coins was created on value zero.

Four while loops aws builted to subtract coin value of change and
sum 1 to coins. 

When change is reduced to zero a print is called to show coins value.
